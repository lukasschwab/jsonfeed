`jsonfeed` is a Python package for parsing and constructing [JSON Feeds](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1). It explicitly supports JSON Feed Version 1.1.

## Usage

This package's constructor arguments and class variables exactly match the field names defined in the JSON feed spec. I hope that the code is clear enough that the spec can be its granular documentation.

### Installation

Install this package with `pip`:

```shell
$ pip install jsonfeed-util
```

In your Python code, include the line

```python
import jsonfeed
```

### Parsing a JSON feed

```python
import jsonfeed as jf
import requests

# Requesting a valid JSON feed!
r = requests.get('https://arxiv-feeds.appspot.com/json/test')
# Parse from raw text...
feed_from_text = jf.Feed.parse_string(r.text)
# ...or parse JSON separately.
r_json = r.json()
feed_from_json = jf.Feed.parse(r_json)
```

### Constructing a JSON feed

```python
import jsonfeed as jf

me = jf.Author(
  name="Lukas Schwab",
  url="https://github.com/lukasschwab"
)
feed = jf.Feed("My Feed Title", authors=[me])
item = jf.Item("some_item_id")
feed.items.append(item)

print(feed.to_json())
```

`jsonfeed` exposes constructors for five classes of JSON feed objects:

+ `Feed`
+ `Author`
+ `Hub`
+ `Item`
+ `Attachment`

Note, `jsonfeed` is designed to be minimally restrictive. It does not require fields that are not required in the JSON Feed spec. This means it's possible to construct non-meaningful JSON feeds (e.g. with this valid `Author` object: `{}`).

### Examples

+ [`arxiv-feeds`](https://github.com/lukasschwab/arxiv-feeds): converts Atom to JSON feeds.
+ [`jsonfeed-wrapper`](https://github.com/lukasschwab/jsonfeed-wrapper): converts scraped HTML to JSON feeds.
+ [`pandoc-blog`](https://github.com/lukasschwab/pandoc-blog): generates a JSON feed for a static site.

## Deprecations

See [the spec](https://jsonfeed.org/) for an overview of deprecated JSON Feed fields. This project (especially the `converters` and the parsing functions) will stay backwards-compatible when possible, but using deprecated fields when constructing feeds is discouraged.

### JSON Feed 1.1

+ `Feed.author` is deprecated. Use `Feed.authors`.
+ `Item.author` is deprecated. Use `Item.authors`.

## Notes

+ Dictionaries maintain insertion order as of Python 3.6. `jsonfeed` takes advantage of this to retain the order suggested in the JSON Feed spec (namely, that `version` appear at the top of the JSON object). This order may not be enforced in earlier versions of Python, but out-of-order JSON Feeds are not invalid.

+ I made a conscious decision to shoot for code that's readable––vis à vis the JSON Feed spec––rather than code that's minimal or performant. Additionally, I opted to avoid dependencies outside of the standard library. Hopefully this makes for easy maintenance.
